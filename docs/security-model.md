# Security Model

DojOps implements defense-in-depth with seven layers between LLM output and infrastructure changes. No LLM output is trusted — every response crosses a trust boundary and is validated at every subsequent layer.

## Layer Details

### Layer 1: Structured Output Enforcement

Every LLM request uses provider-native JSON modes to constrain output format:

| Provider  | Mechanism                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI    | `response_format: { type: "json_object" }`        |
| Anthropic | JSON prefill technique (assistant message prefix) |
| Ollama    | `format: "json"`                                  |
| DeepSeek  | OpenAI-compatible `response_format`               |
| Gemini    | `responseMimeType: "application/json"`            |

This prevents free-text responses and ensures the LLM produces parseable JSON.

### Layer 2: Schema Validation

All LLM responses pass through `parseAndValidate()`:

1. **Markdown stripping** — Removes code fences that LLMs sometimes add
2. **JSON parsing** — `JSON.parse()` with error handling
3. **Zod validation** — `safeParse()` against the expected schema

If validation fails, the response is rejected before any execution occurs. This applies to:

- Tool input schemas
- Tool output schemas
- TaskGraph schemas
- API request schemas

### Layer 3: Deep Verification

External tool validation (enabled by default in CLI; `--skip-verify` to disable):

| Tool           | Verifier                   | What It Checks                                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Terraform      | `terraform validate`       | HCL syntax, provider requirements, resource validity   |
| Dockerfile     | `hadolint`                 | Dockerfile best practices, security issues             |
| Kubernetes     | `kubectl --dry-run=client` | Manifest structure, API version compatibility          |
| GitHub Actions | Structure lint (built-in)  | `on` trigger, `jobs` section, `runs-on`, step validity |
| GitLab CI      | Structure lint (built-in)  | Job `script` fields, `stages` array, stage references  |

Verification runs by default for CLI commands (`apply`, `plan --execute`). It gracefully skips if external tools are not installed. Failed verification blocks execution. The SDK default (`skipVerification: true`) remains unchanged for programmatic callers.

### Layer 4: Policy Engine

`ExecutionPolicy` provides fine-grained control:

- **Write permissions** — `allowWrite` must be `true` for any file operations
- **DevOps write allowlist** — When no explicit `allowedPaths` are set, only DevOps files (CI configs, Dockerfiles, Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, etc.) can be written. This prevents LLM-generated code from mutating application source files. Bypass with `--allow-all-paths`
- **Path allowlists** — `allowedPaths` restricts where files can be written (takes precedence over DevOps allowlist)
- **Path denylists** — `deniedPaths` blocks specific paths (takes precedence over everything)
- **Environment isolation** — `envVars` controls available environment variables
- **Timeouts** — `timeoutMs` prevents runaway operations
- **Size limits** — `maxFileSize` prevents oversized file writes

### Layer 5: Approval Workflows

Before any write operation, the `ApprovalHandler` is invoked:

- **Interactive mode** — Shows a diff preview and prompts the user for confirmation
- **Auto-approve** — For `--yes` flag and automated pipelines
- **Auto-deny** — For `--dry-run` and testing

The approval context includes file paths, content preview, and tool name.

### Layer 6: Sandboxed Execution

`SandboxedFs` wraps all file operations:

- Path validation against the execution policy
- File size validation before writes
- Atomic write operations (temp-file + `fs.renameSync` — POSIX atomic rename prevents partial writes on crash)
- Per-file audit logging (path, size, timestamp, operation)

All 12 built-in tools and plugin tools also use `atomicWriteFileSync()` from `@dojops/sdk` for direct file writes outside the sandbox.

### Layer 7: Immutable Audit Log

Every operation produces a hash-chained audit entry:

- **Append-only** — Entries are appended to `.dojops/history/audit.jsonl` (JSONL format, SIEM-compatible)
- **Hash chain** — Each entry's hash includes the previous entry's hash (SHA-256)
- **Tamper detection** — `dojops history verify` recomputes all hashes and detects any modifications
- **Structured entries** — Each entry includes seq, timestamp, command, tool, status, verification result

## Trust Boundary

```
 UNTRUSTED                    TRUST BOUNDARY                    TRUSTED
+-----------+            +--------------------+            +-------------+
| LLM       |  ----->    | Structured Output  |  ----->    | Validated   |
| Response  |            | + Schema Validation|            | Tool Input  |
+-----------+            +--------------------+            +-------------+
```

LLM output is treated as untrusted external input. The trust boundary is at the Structured Output + Schema Validation layers. Only data that passes both layers enters the trusted execution pipeline.

---

## Concurrency Safety

PID-based execution locking prevents concurrent mutations:

- **Lock file** — `.dojops/lock.json` containing `{ pid, command, timestamp }`
- **Mutual exclusion** — Only one `apply`, `destroy`, or `rollback` operation at a time
- **Stale lock cleanup** — If the locking PID is dead, the lock is automatically removed
- **Exit code 4** — Returned when a lock conflict is detected

---

## Security Scanning

Beyond the execution pipeline, DojOps provides proactive security scanning via `@dojops/scanner`:

- 8 scanners covering vulnerabilities, dependencies, IaC issues, secrets, shell scripts, and SBOM generation
- Exit codes 6 (HIGH) and 7 (CRITICAL) for CI/CD integration
- LLM-powered remediation with path-traversal protection

See [Security Scanning](security-scanning.md) for details.

---

## Plugin Isolation

Plugin tools execute through the same `SafeExecutor` pipeline as built-in tools (inheriting `maxFileSize`, `timeoutMs`, DevOps write allowlist, and per-file audit logging), plus three additional security controls:

### Verification Command Whitelist

The `verification.command` field in plugin manifests can only invoke whitelisted binaries:

```
terraform, kubectl, helm, ansible-lint, docker, hadolint,
yamllint, jsonlint, shellcheck, tflint, kubeval, conftest,
checkov, trivy, kube-score, polaris
```

Any other command (e.g., `curl`, `rm`, `bash`) is rejected at runtime with a descriptive error.

### Permission Enforcement

The `permissions.child_process` field controls whether verification commands execute:

| Value        | Behavior                                            |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `"required"` | Command is checked against whitelist, then executed |
| `"none"`     | Command is never executed (skip)                    |
| _(omitted)_  | Default-safe: command is never executed             |

This ensures plugins cannot execute shell commands unless they explicitly declare `child_process: "required"` AND the command is whitelisted.

### Path Traversal Prevention

File paths in `files[].path` and `detector.path` are validated at schema level — any segment containing `..` is rejected. This prevents plugins from writing to or detecting files outside the project directory (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`).

### Plugin Hash Integrity

Each plugin has a SHA-256 hash computed from its `plugin.yaml` content. This hash is pinned into plans at creation time and validated on `--resume` and `--replay` to detect plugin modifications between plan creation and execution. See [Plugin Specification v1](PLUGIN_SPEC_v1.md) for the full security model.

### Replay Validation

`dojops apply --replay` enforces deterministic reproducibility by:

1. Forcing `temperature: 0` via a `DeterministicProvider` wrapper
2. Validating `provider` and `model` match the plan's execution context
3. Validating `systemPromptHash` for plugin tasks to detect prompt drift

If any check fails, replay is aborted unless `--yes` forces continuation.

---

## Plan Risk Classification

Plans are automatically classified into risk levels based on tool types and keyword analysis:

- **LOW** — CI/CD and monitoring tools (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Makefile, Prometheus)
- **MEDIUM** — Infrastructure tools (Terraform, Dockerfile, Kubernetes, Helm, Docker Compose, Ansible, Nginx, Systemd)
- **HIGH** — Any task mentioning IAM, security groups, production, secrets, credentials, RBAC, roles, or permissions

HIGH risk plans require explicit confirmation even with `--yes` (unless `--force` is also set), adding a safety gate before potentially dangerous operations.

---

## Drift Awareness

Before execution, `apply` displays informational warnings for stateful tools (Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, Ansible) reminding users that DojOps validates local config files but does not inspect remote state. Users are advised to run the appropriate tool-native drift check (e.g., `terraform plan`, `kubectl diff`) before applying.

---

## Plan Snapshot Freezing

Plans capture an execution context snapshot at creation time:

- **DojOps version** — Detects version mismatches between plan creation and execution
- **Policy hash** — SHA-256 of the execution policy, detecting policy changes
- **Tool versions** — Per-tool version metadata for reproducibility

In `--replay` mode, version mismatches are blocking errors. In normal `apply` mode, mismatches produce informational warnings.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Keep verification enabled** (the default) in production for Terraform, Dockerfile, and Kubernetes tools. Only use `--skip-verify` for speed during development
2. **Review diffs** before approving write operations in interactive mode
3. **Run `dojops history verify`** periodically to check audit trail integrity
4. **Use `--dry-run`** to preview changes before applying
5. **Restrict `allowedPaths`** in execution policies to limit blast radius
6. **Run `dojops scan`** after applying changes to check for introduced vulnerabilities
