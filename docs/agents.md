# Specialist Agents

ODA includes 16 specialist agents for intelligent prompt routing. Each agent is a domain expert with a tailored system prompt, keyword set, and optional tool dependencies.

---

## How Routing Works

When you send a prompt to ODA, the `AgentRouter` scores it against each agent's keyword list:

1. **Keyword matching** — Each agent has a set of domain-specific keywords. The router counts how many keywords appear in the prompt.
2. **Confidence scoring** — The score is normalized based on keyword match density. Higher scores indicate stronger domain relevance.
3. **Threshold check** — If the highest-scoring agent exceeds the confidence threshold, the prompt is routed to that specialist.
4. **Fallback** — If no agent exceeds the threshold, the prompt goes to the general-purpose `DevOpsAgent`.

The selected agent's system prompt is prepended to the LLM request, providing domain-specific instructions and constraints.

## Using Agents

### CLI

```bash
# List all agents
oda agents list

# Show agent details
oda agents info terraform-specialist

# Pin chat to an agent
oda chat --agent=terraform
```

### API

```bash
# List all agents
curl http://localhost:3000/api/agents
```

### Automatic Routing

Agents are selected automatically based on prompt content. No manual routing is needed:

```bash
# Routes to terraform-specialist (matches: terraform, s3, iac)
oda "Create a Terraform config for S3"

# Routes to kubernetes-specialist (matches: kubernetes, deployment, nginx)
oda "Write a Kubernetes deployment for nginx"

# Routes to cicd-specialist (matches: github actions, pipeline, ci)
oda "Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline"

# Routes to ops-cortex (matches: plan, multi-step, end-to-end)
oda plan "Set up end-to-end CI/CD with Docker and Kubernetes"
```

---

## Agent Configuration

Agents are defined in `packages/core/src/agents/specialists.ts`. Each agent specifies:

- `name` — Unique identifier
- `domain` — Category label
- `description` — System prompt context
- `keywords` — Array of matching keywords for routing
- `toolDependencies` — Optional external tools

All agents include a `NO_FOLLOWUP_INSTRUCTION` suffix ensuring single-shot responses without conversational follow-ups.

## Specialized Analyzers

In addition to the 16 routed agents, ODA provides three specialized analyzers that are invoked directly (not via `AgentRouter`):

| Analyzer       | Class               | Input                | Output Schema             | CLI Command        |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| CI Debugger    | `CIDebugger`        | CI log content       | `CIDiagnosisSchema`       | `oda debug ci`     |
| Infra Diff     | `InfraDiffAnalyzer` | Diff content         | `InfraDiffAnalysisSchema` | `oda analyze diff` |
| DevOps Checker | `DevOpsChecker`     | context.json + files | `CheckReportSchema`       | `oda check`        |

### DevOps Checker

The `DevOpsChecker` (`packages/core/src/agents/devops-checker.ts`) analyzes DevOps files detected during `oda init` for quality, security, and best practices. It produces:

- **Maturity score** (0-100) — Minimal (0-25), Basic (26-50), Good (51-75), Excellent (76-100)
- **Findings** — Severity-ranked issues (`critical`, `error`, `warning`, `info`) categorized as security, quality, best-practice, performance, or reliability
- **Missing files** — Important DevOps files the project should have but doesn't

```bash
oda check                  # Display formatted report
oda check --output json    # Machine-readable JSON output
```
