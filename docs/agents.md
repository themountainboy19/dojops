# Specialist Agents

DojOps includes 17 built-in specialist agents for intelligent prompt routing, plus support for user-defined **custom agents**. Each agent is a domain expert with a tailored system prompt, keyword set, and optional tool dependencies.

---

## How Routing Works

When you send a prompt to DojOps, the `AgentRouter` scores it against each agent's keyword list:

1. **Keyword matching** — Each agent has a set of domain-specific keywords. The router counts how many keywords appear in the prompt.
2. **Confidence scoring** — The score is normalized based on keyword match density. Higher scores indicate stronger domain relevance.
3. **Threshold check** — If the highest-scoring agent exceeds the confidence threshold, the prompt is routed to that specialist.
4. **Fallback** — If no agent exceeds the threshold, the prompt goes to the general-purpose `DevOpsAgent`.

The selected agent's system prompt is prepended to the LLM request, providing domain-specific instructions and constraints.

## Using Agents

### CLI

```bash
# List all agents
dojops agents list

# Show agent details (partial names supported)
dojops agents info terraform              # matches terraform-specialist
dojops agents info security               # matches security-auditor
dojops agents info cloud                  # matches cloud-architect
dojops agents info terraform-specialist   # exact name also works

# Pin chat to an agent
dojops chat --agent=terraform
```

### API

```bash
# List all agents
curl http://localhost:3000/api/agents
```

### Automatic Routing

Agents are selected automatically based on prompt content. No manual routing is needed:

```bash
# Routes to terraform-specialist (matches: terraform, s3, iac)
dojops "Create a Terraform config for S3"

# Routes to kubernetes-specialist (matches: kubernetes, deployment, nginx)
dojops "Write a Kubernetes deployment for nginx"

# Routes to cicd-specialist (matches: github actions, pipeline, ci)
dojops "Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline"

# Routes to ops-cortex (matches: plan, multi-step, end-to-end)
dojops plan "Set up end-to-end CI/CD with Docker and Kubernetes"
```

---

## Custom Agents

In addition to the 17 built-in agents, you can create your own custom agents. Custom agents participate in the same keyword-based routing as built-in agents and can even override built-in agents by name.

### Agent Definition Format

Each custom agent is a directory with a structured `README.md`:

```
.dojops/agents/sre-specialist/README.md
```

```markdown
# SRE Specialist

## Domain

site-reliability

## Description

SRE specialist for incident response, reliability engineering, and observability.

## System Prompt

You are an SRE specialist. You specialize in:

- Incident response and post-mortems
- SLO/SLI design and error budgets
- Chaos engineering and resilience testing
- On-call runbooks and escalation procedures
- Capacity planning and performance optimization

When asked about infrastructure, focus on reliability patterns...

## Keywords

sre, incident, reliability, error budget, slo, chaos, postmortem, runbook, on-call, resilience
```

Required sections: `## Domain`, `## Description`, `## System Prompt`, `## Keywords` (comma-separated).

### Discovery Paths

Custom agents are discovered from two locations:

| Location | Path                                | Scope                      |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Project  | `.dojops/agents/<name>/README.md`   | Current project only       |
| Global   | `~/.dojops/agents/<name>/README.md` | Shared across all projects |

Project agents override global agents with the same name.

### Creating Custom Agents

**LLM-generated** (recommended):

```bash
dojops agents create "an SRE specialist for incident response and reliability"
```

The LLM generates a complete agent definition (name, domain, description, system prompt, keywords) and writes the README.md to `.dojops/agents/<name>/`.

**Manual creation**:

```bash
dojops agents create --manual
```

Interactive prompts guide you through defining name, domain, description, system prompt, and keywords.

**Global agents** (shared across projects):

```bash
dojops agents create --global "a cost optimization specialist"
```

### Managing Custom Agents

```bash
# List all agents (built-in + custom)
dojops agents list

# Show agent details (includes source path for custom agents)
dojops agents info sre-specialist

# Remove a custom agent
dojops agents remove sre-specialist
```

### Routing with Custom Agents

Custom agents are routed exactly like built-in agents — by keyword matching. If a custom agent's keywords match the prompt with higher confidence than any built-in agent, the custom agent handles the request:

```bash
# Routes to custom sre-specialist (matches: sre, error budget, slo)
dojops "Design SLOs and error budgets for our payment service"
```

---

## Built-in Agent Configuration

Built-in agents are defined in `packages/core/src/agents/specialists.ts`. Each agent specifies:

- `name` — Unique identifier
- `domain` — Category label
- `description` — System prompt context
- `keywords` — Array of matching keywords for routing
- `toolDependencies` — Optional external tools

All agents include a `NO_FOLLOWUP_INSTRUCTION` suffix ensuring single-shot responses without conversational follow-ups.

---

## Specialized Analyzers

In addition to the 17 routed agents, DojOps provides three specialized analyzers that are invoked directly (not via `AgentRouter`):

| Analyzer       | Class               | Input                | Output Schema             | CLI Command           |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| CI Debugger    | `CIDebugger`        | CI log content       | `CIDiagnosisSchema`       | `dojops debug ci`     |
| Infra Diff     | `InfraDiffAnalyzer` | Diff content         | `InfraDiffAnalysisSchema` | `dojops analyze diff` |
| DevOps Checker | `DevOpsChecker`     | context.json + files | `CheckReportSchema`       | `dojops check`        |

### DevOps Checker

The `DevOpsChecker` (`packages/core/src/agents/devops-checker.ts`) analyzes DevOps files detected during `dojops init` for quality, security, and best practices. It produces:

- **Maturity score** (0-100) — Minimal (0-25), Basic (26-50), Good (51-75), Excellent (76-100)
- **Findings** — Severity-ranked issues (`critical`, `error`, `warning`, `info`) categorized as security, quality, best-practice, performance, or reliability
- **Missing files** — Important DevOps files the project should have but doesn't

```bash
dojops check                  # Display formatted report
dojops check --output json    # Machine-readable JSON output
```
