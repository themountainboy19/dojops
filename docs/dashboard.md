# Web Dashboard

ODA includes a web dashboard with a dark industrial terminal aesthetic for monitoring metrics, browsing agents, and reviewing execution history. Start it with `oda serve`.

---

## Starting the Dashboard

```bash
oda serve                    # http://localhost:3000
oda serve --port=8080        # Custom port
```

The serve command:

1. Resolves provider configuration (CLI flags > env vars > config file)
2. Creates all required dependencies (provider, tools, router, debugger, diff analyzer)
3. Detects project root for metrics (`.oda/` directory)
4. Starts the Express server with the web dashboard

## Tab Overview

The dashboard has 5 tabs organized in a sidebar:

| Tab      | Category   | Auto-Refresh | Description                                          |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Overview | Metrics    | 30s          | Plan/execution/scan aggregates and activity timeline |
| Security | Metrics    | 30s          | Scan findings, severity trends, category breakdown   |
| Audit    | Metrics    | 30s          | Hash chain integrity, command distribution, timeline |
| Agents   | Operations | --           | Browse and search all 16 specialist agents           |
| History  | Operations | --           | Execution history with type filtering                |

A visual divider separates the metrics tabs (Overview, Security, Audit) from the operational tabs (Agents, History).

## Tabs

### Overview

The overview tab displays aggregated metrics:

- **Health banner** — Provider status and connectivity
- **Stat cards** — Total plans, success rate, total executions, critical/high findings
- **Most used commands** — Distribution of CLI/API commands
- **Recent activity timeline** — Chronological list of recent operations

Data source: `.oda/plans/`, `.oda/execution-logs/`, `.oda/scan-history/`

### Security

The security tab provides visibility into scan findings:

- **Severity breakdown** — Bar chart of CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW findings
- **Category distribution** — SECURITY, DEPENDENCY, IAC, SECRETS
- **Findings table** — Paginated list of findings with severity, tool, message, file/line
- **Scan history** — Timeline of past scans with summary stats
- **Top recurring issues** — Most frequently appearing findings

Data source: `.oda/scan-history/*.json`

### Audit

The audit tab shows the hash-chained audit trail:

- **Integrity badge** — Shows whether the hash chain is valid (verified end-to-end)
- **Status breakdown** — success/failure/cancelled counts
- **Command distribution** — Which commands generated audit entries
- **Hash chain entries** — Individual entries with seq, timestamp, command, status, hash

Data source: `.oda/history/audit.jsonl`

### Agents

The agents tab lets you browse all 16 specialist agents:

- **Search** — Live search by agent name or keyword
- **Domain filters** — Click domain chips to filter agents by category
- **Agent cards** — Each card shows name, domain, description, and keywords

No auto-refresh — agent data is static.

### History

The history tab shows execution history:

- **Type filter** — Dropdown to filter by operation type (All, Generate, Plan, Debug CI, Diff)
- **Clear button** — Delete all history entries
- **Entry list** — Each entry shows operation type, timestamp, and status
- **Detail expansion** — Click an entry to see full details (input, output, agent used)

---

## Features

### Auto-Refresh

The metrics tabs (Overview, Security, Audit) automatically refresh every 30 seconds. An indicator is shown on these tabs.

### Provider Status

The sidebar footer shows the connected LLM provider with a status badge. Mobile view shows this in the header.

### Design

- **Theme** — Dark industrial terminal aesthetic
- **Fonts** — JetBrains Mono (code) + Outfit (headings) from Google Fonts
- **Background** — Decorative grid with glow layers
- **Responsive** — Mobile-friendly with hamburger menu and overlay navigation
- **Notifications** — Toast notification container for success/error messages

## Metrics Data

The dashboard pulls metrics from the `MetricsAggregator`, which reads `.oda/` project data on-demand:

| Metric Type | Data Sources                                                | Endpoint                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Overview    | `.oda/plans/`, `.oda/execution-logs/`, `.oda/scan-history/` | `GET /api/metrics/overview` |
| Security    | `.oda/scan-history/*.json`                                  | `GET /api/metrics/security` |
| Audit       | `.oda/history/audit.jsonl`                                  | `GET /api/metrics/audit`    |

Metrics are disabled if no `.oda/` project directory is found. The dashboard gracefully shows empty states in this case.

## Requirements

- The dashboard requires a running LLM provider for generation features
- Metrics tabs require `oda init` to have been run (creates `.oda/` directory)
- No authentication required (local access only)
